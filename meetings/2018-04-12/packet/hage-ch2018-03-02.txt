 Machines used by all non-mail voters Pros:
 * Paper+Electronic CVR has the highest security/integrity. Digital signatures can be printed on ballots to authenticate paper.
 * Time to vote can be less than marking.
 * Mistakes can be undone without needing another ballot to mark.
+* Eliminates errors like overvotes and ambiguous marks requiring adjudication.
+* Ranked Choice contests can have rankings for all candidates, not just 3,
+eliminating exhausted ballots.
 * Machines could read a QR code from a vote at home app to print a ballot immediately.
 * A separate non-mail ballot format from voting machines would be the same for ordinary voters and those with special needs.
 * Extra machines provide redundancy vs a single disability-access machine.

-Additional ballot box scanner Cons: [TODO]
+Even though an electronic CVR exists within the voting machine, it may still be
+useful to have a full scanner at the precinct, so all CVRs are derived from
+the scanned paper read by the voter, and scanned images are available immediately
+at the end of election day. However, without a full precinct scanner, vote
+totals would still be available at the end of the day, and a central scanner
+could be used after the election for a 100% audit of paper ballots (paper CVRs).
 
+If only machine-printed ballots are collected (no undervote/overvote/ambiguous
+mark detection is required), then a simple plain COTS scanner could be used
+to feed the ballot paper in the collection bin, only recording the ballot images.
+
+Additional ballot box scanner Pros:
+
+* CVRs are derived from the paper verified by voters, not an indirect stored CVR (one criticism of "Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail" is that the human-read paper record is typically not 100% checked)
+
+* Scanned ballot images can be recorded during the election and available
+immediately afterwards.

+* Voting machines and scanners could use independent equipment and software,
+increasing security.

+* Precinct scanners for casting voting-machine printed ballots could also be
+used to scan vote-by-mail (hand-marked) ballots.

+* A precinct scanner could be used with text-to-speech to read back a ballot

+
+Additional ballot box scanner Cons:
+
+* Additional equipment is required which is in theory, unnecessary.

+* A full scanner capable of error detection on hand-marked ballots might

+RAVBM used in precincts Pros:
+
+* Simplifies the software-- a single accessible voting software system is required both for accessible vote-by-mail and precinct voting. Likewise scanner software for reading RAVBM ballot paper would be reused for precinct voting.
+
+* An RAVBM system inherently must use COTS hardware, so only COTS hardware would be needed to implement accessible precinct voting.

+RAVBM used in precincts Cons:
+
+* The hardware and software used by RAVBM would probably not be considered as secure as smaller and more specialized software running on a secure microcomputer.
