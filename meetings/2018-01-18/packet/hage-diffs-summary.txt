Summary of proposed changes to the SFOSVTAC recommendations:
Carl Hage 1/17/2018

Added some glossary entries for "Remote Accessible Vote By Mail"
(summary of the legal definition - required by 2020), and "Paper CVR"
legal definition of printout with voter choices listed. In hardware
and software components, referenced vote by mail in accessible devices.

Some new/added links:
 - Other Open Source Voting Projects and Research:
   - pvote, votebox projects
   - research papers on user interfaces
 - OSET TrustTheVote VoteStream election results prototype
 - Usenix paper on OVC describing COTS-based voting system
 - California Election Laws and Regulations section
 
Proposed new Possible First Components topics:
+6. Ballot Batch Management (Software)
+7. Audit Support (Software)
[See descriptions in the diffs. Ballot batch management is just
something that needs to be thought out to support the scanner and
totaler. If the first steps are used as an audit, then some
supporting sotware might be needed (could be Colorado-RLA).]

- noted possible use with accessible vote-by-mail of open picture
  interpreter to verify home-scanned ballots.
  
- added explicit computer-readable outputs produced by results reporters.

- added notes to ballot picture interpreter: use case for remote
  accessible vote by mail. Added requirements to identify extraneous
  and ambiguous marks requiring adjudication. Added note to be
  able to scan header/footer marking pages enclosing a ballot batch.
