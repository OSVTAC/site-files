+##### 5.2.3.6. Ballot Batch Management (Software)
+
+**Complexity:** Low
+
+**Description.** This is a software component that allows boxes of ballots
+to be organized into batches for scanning and auditing. Labels may be
+printed to be attached to ballot boxes collected, transported, and stored.
+Batches of ballots might include a scannable header page, marking the
+beginning of a batch of ballots, and a scannable footer page, marking the
+end of the batch. The header/footer pages mark the consolidated precinct
+and other information identifying the ballot batch, and might also include
+signatures from poll workers, and digital audit information, e.g.
+IDs, temporary digital signatures and keys, starting and ending hash chain
+codes from a precinct scanner. An additional header/footer page might be
+created to wrap and identify outstacked ballots.
+
+The batch management system would be used to:
+
+* create box labels and header/footer pages,
+
+* provide a database of batch IDs with associated precinct and grouping
+  IDs,
+
+* provide a means to scan box labels and log departure/arrival of ballot boxes
+  transported or stored/retrieved,
+
+* provide the input to the ballot picture interpreter identifying the
+  batch being processed, and associated information (e.g. precinct ID),
+
+* organize scan batches to associate CVR (Cast Vote Record) data
+  with ballot box storage ID and location, and
+
+* track progress of scanning, adjudication, and auditing of ballot batches.
+
+**Interfaces / data formats.** Needs to accept as input:
+

+  by precinct, used to organize batch collections.

+

+formats should be spelled out.
+
+**Possible dependencies / pre-requisites.** Batch management procedures
+need to be defined so batch IDs can be included with the Ballot Picture
+Interpreter output CVRs and used with the Vote Totaler.
+
+##### 5.2.3.7. Audit Support (Software)
+
+**Complexity:** Medium
+
+**Description.** This is a software component that manges an audit
+process that includes a manual count. A precinct-based audit might
+be performed, where all ballots in ramdomly selected precincts are
+hand-counted, or a RLA (Risk Limiting Audit) might be performed,
+where a randomly selected set of ballots among all precincts are
+selected for a hand-count. The number of ballot selected in an
+RLA is based on a statistical formula depending on the closeness of
+votes between top contenders.
+
+Audit support software could include the following:
+
+* Save or generate random number seeds or precinct selections.
+
+* For an RLA, a public high-quality random number generator is used to randomly
+  select ballots to be pulled.
+
+* For ballots selected by order within a batch (does not have a printed
+  and sorted ID), a scanner might be used to sheet feed ballots, stopping
+  where a ballot needs to be pulled.
+
+* If the order in a stored ballot batch does not match the order on stored
+  CVRs (cast vote records) and no ballot IDs are available, a new central scan
+  and picture image analysis might be required.
+
+* Retrieve the CVRs for selected ballots and pass them to the vote totaler
+
+* Enter hand-count results and compare totals with the official precinct
+  totals or the totaled CVR selection.
+
+**Interfaces / data formats.** Needs to accept as input:
+
+* the “election definition” data (e.g. contests, candidates, districts, etc.).
+
+* a definition of batches with precincts, precinct consolidation, and ballot type.
+
+* results of the vote totaler.
+

+
+* for an RLA, the randomly selected ballots with either ID or sequence in
+  a batch.
+
+* comparison of hand counts and machine counts
+
+* scanner controls if used to pull RLA selected ballots
+
+**Other outcomes / deliverables.** The required input and output data and
+formats should be spelled out.
+
+**Possible dependencies / pre-requisites.** If an RLA audit is performed
+and stored ballots might not match ordered CVRs, then the central ballot
+scan and picture interpreter would be required to perform an electronic
+recount of all ballots and generate matching CVRs. If the picture interpreter
+can run at the speed of the scanner, regenerating CVRs (for an electronic
+recount) adds no extra cost.
