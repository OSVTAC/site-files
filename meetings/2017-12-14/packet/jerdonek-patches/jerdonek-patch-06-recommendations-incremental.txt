+**Complexity:** Medium
+
+**Description.** This is a software component to let one "reverse engineer"
+structured ballot layout data from existing paper ballots from another vendor.
+This component may be needed during a possible interim phase in which
+open-source components are used for scanning and interpreting ballots that are
+generated by a different vendor (i.e. the City's vendor during the time
+when the open-source system is being developed).  This component will be
+needed if that vendor is not able to provide structured ballot layout data
+along with the paper ballots.  It is likely that this component will
+not be completely automated, but rather will be semi-automated.
+
+**Interfaces / data formats.** Needs to accept as input:
+
+* the “election definition” data (e.g. contests, candidates, districts, etc.).
+
+* the digital ballot pictures.
+
+Needs to output for each ballot type:
+
+* the “ballot layout” data (e.g. where contests are located on each ballot
+card for each ballot type, etc.) that will be used as input to the Ballot
+Picture Interpreter component.
+
+**Other outcomes / deliverables.** The required input and output data and
+formats should be spelled out.
+
+**Possible dependencies / pre-requisites.** Real data from past elections for
+proto-typing and testing. Samples of ballots from past elections and/or the
+interim voting system.
